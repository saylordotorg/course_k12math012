**Unit 2: Linear Functions** <span id="2"></span> 
*Math students often ask, “How can I use this? What’s it for?” The
answer is “modeling.” Mathematics is designed to help model real-world
phenomena and trends. Modeling allows us to apply mathematics to
situations such as predicting population growth, balancing costs and
profits, developing inventions, or clarifying the shape of terrain where
a road must go. As you learn mathematics, it is important to acquire
skill in creating functions to describe our world. The power of
mathematics is in its application to real life.*  
    
 *As you delve into specific functions in this and additional units, you
will not only learn mathematical processes but also about using
functions to model situations. You begin with a familiar form - linear.
Linear functions are well named because their graphs are lines. This
unit begins by describing linear functions and their graphs. It applies
those concepts to modeling as you learn to fit a line to a set of data
points and measure how close to being linear those points actually are.
The unit closes by exploring absolute value functions and their
graphs. *

**2.1 Linear Functions** <span id="2.1"></span> 
*Some of the concepts in this subunit will be familiar and part of the
material will be review. Focus carefully; there are seeds of ideas in
this unit that will grow into bigger ideas as they are applied to more
complex functions in the later parts of the course. This subunit defines
linear functions and investigates how to find the rate of change of a
function.*

**2.1.1 Linear Functions** <span id="2.1.1"></span> 
*Suppose the local fitness center charges $80 to join and $35 every
month that you are a member. The relationship between cost and the
number of months you are a member is linear and can be described as C(n)
= 80 + 35 n. This function would predict your total fitness expense
until the gym raises prices. The subunit begins by defining linear
functions and their characteristics and then investigates how to find
the rate of change.*

**2.1.2 Rate of Change** <span id="2.1.2"></span> 
*One of the important descriptors of a function is the rate of change.
Linear functions have a constant rate of change. Although there is an
easy way to “see” the rate of change of the algebraic form of a linear
function, it is important to focus on how to determine the rate of
change algebraically. This process will help you understand rate of
change and will be important when you apply it to more complex functions
in subsequent units of the text. This subunit will define rate of change
and apply it to linear functions.*

**2.2 Graphs of Linear Functions** <span id="2.2"></span> 
*As you explore linear functions further, you will apply ideas from Unit
1 to these familiar graphs. In the previous subunit, you learned about
transformations of toolkit functions. This subunit applies those ideas
as it delves into graphs of lines and explores relationships in parallel
and perpendicular lines. It closes by focusing on the intersections of
lines.*

**2.2.1 Graphing Linear Functions** <span id="2.2.1"></span> 
*This subunit begins by reviewing the topics of slopes and intercepts.
It extends the exploration by applying graph transformations as we focus
on shifts and compressions. The subunit closes by identifying the
special types of equations that describe horizontal and vertical lines.*

    transformations as you alter values of *a*, *b, c,* and*x*. Try to
    determine which of the bars controls whether the functions are
    parallel.  
        
     After working with these two functions, rename the *g* function to
    be *g*(*x*) = -(1/*a*)x + c. Move the sliding bars to see the

    perpendicular lines, why would one slope always be positive and the
    other always be negative? Have someone read your paragraphs and help
    you polish them to clarity.

**2.2.3 Intersections of Lines** <span id="2.2.3"></span> 
*The connections between graphs and algebraic forms come together in
this subunit. A graph gives the big picture of the behavior of
functions, but it is the algebraic form that gives specifics. It is
impossible from a small graph to tell if a point is at 2 or 2.00146, but
the algebra can pin things down. This subunit uses graphs to illustrate
the relation between two distinct linear functions and the place at
which they have points in common.*

**2.3 Modeling with Linear Functions** <span id="2.3"></span> 
*Modeling is where mathematics is applied. This subunit focuses on
problem solving and writing models to describe life situations. One of
the secrets of writing an equation lies in translation. Suppose you want
an algebraic description of the following declarative sentence: Doubling
the height is the same as adding five to the width. The key to an
equation is to find the words in the sentence that represent the equal
sign. Everything in front of the words meaning “equal” will be in front
of the equal sign; everything after the words meaning “equal” will be
after the equal sign. Seldom is it necessary to change the order when
translating. The translation is as follows:*  
  

<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">***       Doubling ***</span><span

**2.4 Fitting Linear Models to Data** <span id="2.4"></span> 
*If you wrote down the outside temperature at noon every day from spring
to midsummer, it would tend to get warmer every day, but the data points
would not be on an exact straight line. The points might be
approximately linear, though. This subunit begins with creating a line
on a set of data points to approximate a relation and looks at when it’s
appropriate to predict other values from that line. It explores the use
of technology to create a line of best fit and then introduces the
correlation coefficient, which is a way to measure how well a line
describes the relation among a set of data points.*

**2.4.1 Approximately Linear - Trend Lines** <span id="2.4.1"></span> 
*Many relations are only approximately linear, but sometimes we can use
lines to estimate them. Suppose a dieter gets weighed every Friday. The
weights over time could be approximately linear, but not fall exactly on
a line. This subunit places lines on sets of data, identifies the
equation of each line, and then uses the equation to identify other
values. If, for instance our dieter missed getting weighed one Friday,
the equation of the trend line would make it possible to estimate that
Friday’s weight later on. *

**2.4.2 Interpolation and Extrapolation** <span id="2.4.2"></span> 
*Imagine a girl who is 85 centimeters tall at age 2 and 148 centimeters
at age 9. We could develop a trend line of height as a function of age:
h(a) = 9a + 67. We could use that function to estimate the girl’s height
at age 4, which would be h(4) = 9(4) + 67 = 103 centimeters. That would
probably be a close approximation. This process is called
interpolation.*  
    
 *If, however, we used the function to predict her height at age 70, we
would have h(70) = 9(70) + 67 = 697 centimeters. That would mean that
this girl would grow to nearly 23 feet tall! Extrapolation is using a
trend outside the boundaries of the original input data collected, and
it often leads to wild predictions.*

*Trend lines like the ones you created in the previous subunit are rough
estimates. Statisticians have developed a complex process to find the
“line of best fit,” also called the “least squares regression line.”
Luckily, technology enables us to find the equation of that line while
avoiding the* *intricate mathematical process. This subunit will develop
these regression lines and also introduce the correlation coefficient,
which is a value that indicates how close to a line a set of data points
actually are.*

**2.5 Absolute Value Functions** <span id="2.5"></span> 
*Think of absolute value as distance - that’s why it’s never negative.
As you work through the material in this subunit, it is helpful to keep
the concept of distance in your mind. You will begin with absolute value
and its important features and progress to solving absolute value
equations and inequalities.*

**2.5.1 Defining Absolute Value Functions** <span id="2.5.1"></span> 
*A standard absolute value function can be described with a piecewise
function of two linear functions. This subunit describes the concept of
absolute value and identifies the important features of this type of
function.*

**2.5.2 Solving Absolute Value Equations** <span id="2.5.2"></span> 
*If the absolute value of (x - a) is 7, that means that the distance
between x and a is seven units. So consider the absolute value of (x -
3): if it’s 7, then the distance between x and 3 is seven, meaning x is
seven units away from three - that means that x is at 10 or -4.
Sometimes a number line is a useful way to consider absolute value
equations. This subunit focuses on an algebraic way to solve absolute
value equations and teaches a step-by-step process to address these
sometimes confusing equations.*

**2.5.3 Solving Absolute Value Inequalities** <span id="2.5.3"></span> 
*Inequalities look a lot like equations, but they do not use an equal
sign (=) as the verb. Inequalities use things like \<, \>, and \<.
Keeping the distance idea in mind with absolute value inequalities is
very helpful. In the inequality |x – 3| \< 2, the distance idea can be
useful. Think of this problem as saying the distance between x and 3 is
less than 2 units. That means that x can be 2 units away from three, but
no farther; thus, x has to be somewhere between 1 and 5, inclusive. If
the verb is \>, and we have |x – 3| \> 2, then we know that x is at
least 2 units away from 3, meaning it must be greater than 5 or less
than 1. This subunit focuses on algebraic methods to solving
inequalities that have absolute value statements within them. If you
remember that you can think of absolute value in terms of distance, it
may be much easier to solve the problems*

    further down on the list. It has a picture of a video camera to the
    left.) Watch the “Absolute Value Inequality” video, and focus on
    connecting the idea of distance and absolute value in understanding
    these inequalities.  
      
     Watching this video should take approximately 5 minutes.

-   **Activity: Clarifying the Difference: Inequalities vs Equations**
    Instructions: An equation always has an equal sign for the verb in
    the mathematical sentence. An inequality has a different verb; some
    examples are: \<, \>, \<, \>, and ≠. Solving an inequality is
    similar to solving an equation, but there are some distinct
    differences. Write a short essay explaining how they are alike and
    how they are different. Be sure to clarify why those differences
    occur.  
        
     Completing this activity should take approximately 40 minutes.
