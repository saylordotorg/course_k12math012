Mathematics comes together in this course. You enter precalculus with an
abundant array of experience in mathematics, and this course offers an
opportunity to make connections among the big ideas you encountered
earlier. It also assists you in developing fluency with the tools used
in learning calculus. The focus of this course is the concept of
function - it’s with functions that mathematicians and scientists can
model the world and make leaps of invention, sending rockets to far
planets, determining the future size of populations, and finding the
amount of earth to be moved when creating new roads. The unit begins by
defining and exploring certain attributes of functions and continues
with specific kinds of functions - linear, polynomial, rational,
logarithmic, and exponential. In addition to precalculus being important
for many fields, the subject is obviously designed to prepare you for
calculus, which is the mathematics of things that are changing. Calculus
allows us to find areas of strangely curved shapes and to determine how
fast something is changing at any particular instant. Throughout the
course, you will compare and contrast ideas and apply those concepts to
real-world situations. It’s a great course to help you braid ideas
together and build an internal framework of understanding. As you travel
through precalculus, you will look back over earlier topics and use them
to look forward to new concepts. Here we go!

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

-   Summarize, contrast, and interpret characteristics and properties of
    functions and inequalities - linear, piecewise, quadratic, rational,
    exponential, and logarithmic.
-   Solve equations involving linear, piecewise, quadratic, rational,
    exponential, and logarithmic functions.
-   Graph linear, piecewise, quadratic, rational, exponential, and
    logarithmic functions.
-   Combine functions and determine inverse functions.
-   Interpret roots and maxima and minima of functions.
-   Solve and interpret solutions to real-world problems, using concepts
    of functions, including linear, piecewise, quadratic, rational,
    exponential, and logarithmic functions.
-   Interpret and re-represent functions in other forms, specifically
    numeric, graphic, algebraic, and verbal.
-   Use functions to model real-world phenomena.

### Course Information

Welcome to Precalculus I. Below, please find general information on this
course and its requirements.  
    
 **Course Designer:** [Dr.** **Virginia D. Gray,
PhD](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-a-g/#DrVirginiaDGray)                                   
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following:  

-   Lippman and Rasmussen’s *Precalculus: An Investigation of Functions*
-   Khan Academy videos

**Requirements for Completion:** There are two trails of success in
mathematics, and both are important. First of all you want to see the
big picture, understanding the concepts, using them in the given problem
situations, and eventually being able to apply them in atypical
situations. The second success trail has to do with the focused,
detailed picture in mathematics, which means developing accuracy and
precision. Thus you want to be disciplined in the details when
completing the assigned problems. There is a big difference between 50
and -50, although it can seem insignificant on the written page. (After
all, it's just a little minus sign!) In order to grasp not only the big
ideas but also these accuracy details offered in this course, do the
assigned problems with careful attention. They not only assist you in
understanding and applying the mathematical concepts in each unit, but
also prepare you to grasp subsequent material in future units.  
  
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take a total of 69 hours to
complete, depending upon the background, skill, and effort you bring
into it. Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the amount of
time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These should guide you
along the way.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** Focus on understanding what you are doing. The
early material creates the tools that you will use in the later
material, so make sure you don’t skip over it. The answers in the back
of the text are a learning tool; occasionally you will get the wrong
answer and a tough problem can be cracked by working backward to
understand the process. Be careful of how you use answers. Sometimes
students look at the answer in the back of a text and see that they made
a small mistake - maybe they were missing a minus sign - and it makes
the rest of the problem incorrect. Remember, this means that although
you may have been close, you were NOT correct, and you need more
practice. You need to keep working more problems until you have correct
answers consistently.  
    
 If you are struggling with a topic and the given materials are not
making sense to you, remember that the Internet offers incredible
resources. You can use a search engine to explore resources on whatever
topics you want help with.  
    
 Mathematics involves a lot of writing--not only in the symbolic
notation, but also in taking notes, making charts, and writing
paragraphs of explanation. Please read Lab Space’s Bridge to Success:
[“Writing
Mathematics”](http://labspace.open.ac.uk/mod/oucontent/view.php?id=479219&section=5.1) and
[“Tips for Writing
Mathematics”](http://labspace.open.ac.uk/mod/oucontent/view.php?id=479219&section=5.4).
These two web pages have helpful explanations and tips regarding how to
write in mathematics.  
  
 You will need a scientific graphing calculator. Many smartphones have
scientific calculators embedded (turn the iPhone calculator on the side,
and you will find one). There are also scientific, graphing calculator
apps that you can download.    
    
 Here are some options for graphing calculators:  
  
 [**Texas Instruments, TI Graphing
Calculators**](http://education.ti.com/en/us/products/calculators)  
 Texas Instrument calculators can range from $100 - $300, depending on
the model you purchase. Graphing calculators not only allow you to
perform basic actions such as addition and subtraction, but they also
allow higher order functions such as solving equations. The best feature
of a graphing calculator is its ability to graph functions and produce a
line plotted on a coordinate plane. The best reason for having a
graphing calculator is to use during class or during standardized exams
when computers and mobile devices are not permitted.  
  
 [**Desmos**](https://www.desmos.com/calculator)  
 Desmos offers the same capabilities of a graphing calculator, but it is
available on your computer for free! The browser page allows for basic
functions, and it can also complete equations and graph lines on the
same page. What makes Desmos better than a graphing calculator is its
ability to show the equation next to the graph of the line and your
ability to change the equation for experimentation. The only con is that
it cannot be used during standardized tests, as it requires a
computer.  
  
 [**Microsoft
Math**](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15702#Instructions)  
 Microsoft Math is the same as Desmos, although only available on
Windows operating systems. Microsoft Math can also create 3-D graphs for
higher level functions such as those found in calculus. The program also
allows you to save your work so that it can be preserved or printed out
according to your needs. The only con is that it cannot be used during
standardized tests, as it requires a computer.  
    
 **Mobile Apps: [Quick Graph
(iOS)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quick-graph/id292412367?mt=8) and [Algeo
(Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.algeo.algeo&hl=en)**  
 Both apps are capable of computing lower order operations and higher
level functions such as graphing equations. They also allow for the
ability to graph in 2-D and 3-D, which means they can be used for
calculus level work. The apps cannot, however, transfer your work to
other devices, which prevents them from leaving your mobile device.
Since the apps are only for mobile devices, they cannot be used on
standardized tests.
